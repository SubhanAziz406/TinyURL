        <p>TheTinyURLs.com respects the intellectual property rights of others and expects its users to do the same. In compliance with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), we have adopted the following policy to address claims of copyright infringement. If you believe that content available on TheTinyURLs.com infringes upon your copyright, please follow the procedures outlined below to file a claim.</p>

        <h5>Filing a DMCA Takedown Notice</h5>
        <p>If you are a copyright owner or an authorized agent, and you believe that a URL shortened by TheTinyURLs.com infringes upon your copyrighted work, you may submit a DMCA takedown notice. To file a DMCA notice, please provide the following information in writing:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Identification of the copyrighted work you claim has been infringed. If multiple copyrighted works are involved, you may submit a list of the works.</li>
            <li>Identification of the material or link that you claim is infringing, including a clear and specific description of where the infringing content is located on TheTinyURLs.com (such as the specific shortened URL).</li>
            <li>Your contact information, including your name, address, telephone number, and email address.</li>
            <li>A statement that you have a good faith belief that the use of the copyrighted material is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.</li>
            <li>A statement, made under penalty of perjury, that the information in your notice is accurate and that you are the copyright owner or authorized to act on behalf of the owner.</li>
            <li>Your physical or electronic signature.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Please send the DMCA takedown notice to our designated copyright agent at:</p>
        <p>Email: [Insert Email Address]</p>

        <h5>Counter-Notice to Restore Content</h5>
        <p>If you believe that the material that was removed or disabled due to a DMCA takedown notice was not infringing, or if you have the legal right to use the content, you may submit a counter-notice to us. The counter-notice must include the following information:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Identification of the removed content and the location where the material appeared before it was removed or disabled (e.g., the specific shortened URL).</li>
            <li>A statement, under penalty of perjury, that you have a good faith belief that the content was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or misidentification of the material.</li>
            <li>Your contact information, including your name, address, telephone number, and email address.</li>
            <li>A statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of the federal court in your district (or if outside the United States, the jurisdiction of any judicial district in which TheTinyURLs.com may be found) and that you will accept service of process from the party who filed the original DMCA notice or their agent.</li>
            <li>Your physical or electronic signature.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Submit the counter-notice to the designated copyright agent at the contact details provided above. Upon receiving a valid counter-notice, we may restore the content in question unless the original complainant files a lawsuit seeking a court order to prevent further use of the material.</p>

        <h5>Repeat Infringers</h5>
        <p>TheTinyURLs.com reserves the right to terminate user accounts or disable access to the service for users who are found to be repeat infringers of copyright law or this DMCA Policy.</p>

        <h5>False Claims</h5>
        <p>Submitting a false DMCA notice or counter-notice may result in legal liability. Under Section 512(f) of the DMCA, any person who knowingly submits a false claim of copyright infringement may be held liable for damages, including costs and attorneys' fees.</p>

        <h5>Changes to the DMCA Policy</h5>
        <p>We reserve the right to modify this DMCA Policy at any time. Any changes will be posted on this page, and the updated policy will include the effective date of the revision. Please review this policy periodically to stay informed of your rights and responsibilities.</p>
